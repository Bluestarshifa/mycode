<p>My all time favorite movie. (Tied with Princess Mononoke)

Absolutely stunningly fantastic animation and visuals, but great animation and visuals are to be expected from Disney. 

What really makes this film shine is the characters, and the interactions between them. Aladdin is a really good protagonist. They establish in the beginning that while willing to do dirty acts such as stealing (When he stole a loaf of bread) he is still kind and has a pure heart. (When he gives the bread to two poor children) Jasmine isn't the most interesting Disney princess, but she is still a decent character and the chemistry between her and Aladdin is great. Jafar is a memorable and intimidating villain, especially near the end. And last but not least, Robin Williams as the Genie. Need we even speak of the Genie? The character seems like it was made from the ground up for Robin Williams. I truly don't think any other voice actor could have cut it, it was just the perfect casting choice. What is there to say about him that hasn't already been said a bajillion times? I'm serious, y'all got anything? I'm drawing a blank.

The soundtrack is just amazing, there's not a single bad song in this movie, they're all catchy and memorable. One of my favorite songs in any Disney film is A Whole New World. Unless you've been living under a rock since the early 90s, there's a very significant chance you've heard this song at least once. This scene further escalates the relationship between Aladdin and Jasmine, and truly makes it feel like they were made for each other. From a both a musical and visual point of view, this is one of my favorite scenes and songs in all of Disney. I would love to gush about all the other songs in the soundtrack, but that would make this review way too long.

As mentioned before, Jafar is a really great villain, and his battle with Aladdin at the end is great. The climax stands out from the rest of Disney's catalogue because instead of defeating Jafar using brute force, Aladdin defeats him by outsmarting him. The music and visuals during this scene also make it all the more memorable.

Alright, I think you get it, Aladdin is wonderful. It is a 10/10 film, if there ever was one. I genuinely can't think of anything wrong with it. If you haven't watched Aladdin, you need to. Please. You will not regret it in the slightest.
